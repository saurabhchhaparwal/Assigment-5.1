"Prompt.inyb" file submitted has solutions for the promted questions as well as additional analysis performed on "Coupons for Coffee House"

Functions created 
- percent_accept: Since ratio of prospects who used the coupon vs. who didn't was the primary metrics thus, to estimate it again and again, created a function as 
  count of prospects for which Y =1 over total number of prospects in that dataset 

Following is the summary of analysis of Coupns for "Coffee House":
- Desitnation have impact on coffee coupon acceptance. Coupon acceptance is better when cutomer is not in "Hurry" and much lower if they are going to Home or Work.
- Weather has some impact on coffee coupon acceptance. Coupon acceptance is better when it's "Sunny" or "Rainy" weather instead of "Snowy"
- Time is having significant impact on Acceptance rate. Better acceptable rate in Morning and Afternoon than late evenings or night.
- If customer is not within 15 mins distance of coupon place than acceptance rate of coupon is higher and need to add effect of direction of travel
Another Hypothesis I tested : Would Price senstive customer (who spend less than $20 in a visit) and are frequent dinners (>4 times a month) have high chance to accept than others and answer is "Yes"
